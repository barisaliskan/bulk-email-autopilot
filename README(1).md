## 📌 What Does It Do?

This n8n workflow lets you send personalized bulk emails with a PDF attachment (e.g. your CV) to an entire list of addresses — fully automated.

1. 📄 Prepares your PDF as a base64 attachment
2. ⏱️ Waits **3 seconds** between sends to avoid spam filters
3. 📧 Sends a personalized email via **Gmail**
4. 🔁 Loops until every address in the list is processed

## 🚀 Setup

### 1. Requirements
- [n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/getting-started/installation/) (self-hosted or cloud)
- Gmail account with OAuth2 credentials configured in n8n

### 2. Import the Workflow

1. Download `workflow.json`
2. Open your n8n dashboard
3. Click **"Import from file"** and select the file

### 3. Configuration

**`Email Listesi` node** — add your target addresses:
```js
const rawList = `
company1@example.com
company2@example.com
hr@techfirm.com
`;
```

**`CV Hazirla` node** — replace the placeholder with your PDF in base64:
```js
const base64CV = 'YOUR_BASE64_PDF_HERE';
```

To convert your PDF to base64 on the command line:

## ⚠️ Important Notes

| Topic | Detail |
|-------|--------|
| **Spam risk** | Sending too many emails too quickly may get your Gmail flagged. Increase the wait time if needed. |
| **Attachment** | Update the base64 string every time your PDF changes. |
| **Personalization** | Add extra fields (e.g. `companyName`) to the email list and make the template dynamic for per-company customization. |

---

## 🛠️ Customization Tips

- **Change wait time:** Edit the `amount` value in the `Bekleme` node (in seconds)
- **Batch control:** Add a `batchSize` parameter to the `splitInBatches` node to control concurrency
- **Dynamic list:** Replace the hardcoded email list with a Google Sheets node to pull addresses from a spreadsheet
